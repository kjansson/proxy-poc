# udp-proxy-ish
An UDP proxy(-ish) for proxying UDP traffic out of K8s. It is a sidecar-server setup which is 100% transparent to client applications.
A sidecar is deployed to the application which intercepts outgoing UDP traffic on selected ports, and forwards them to an external proxy that can be placed wherever you like.


## Configuration

The proxy and sidecar are configured via environment variables.

### Environment variables

```
PROXY_MODE - Required. Role of the container. Can be "proxy" or "sidecar"
SERVER_ADDRESS - Required for sidecar. For sidecar, this is the address of the proxy side, given in the "ip:port" format. For proxy, this is the ip address to bind to.
SERVER_PORT - Used only in proxy role. Port that the proxy will bind to. Defaults to 11111.
PROXY_INTERCEPT_PORT_RANGE - Required for sidecar. Ports and port ranges that will be intercepted by the sidecar and sent to the proxy. The format is the same as used in iptables --dports option. Examples: "161", "161,162", "161,2002:2005"
```

## Starting the Proxy
```
docker run -it --network host -e SERVER_ADDRESS=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -e PROXY_MODE=server proxy-image
```

## Setting up the sidecar in K8s
The sidecar is deployed in the pod where the UDP traffic originates from. It needs the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to set the correct socket options, and setting up iptables and routing.
